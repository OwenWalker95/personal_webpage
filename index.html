<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> I have been programming since early 2023 (If you don't count tinkering with Runescape bots in the early 2010s!). 
My entry to this was through game development, dabbling with C# through using the Unity game engine, but I soon realised
 that programming was the element of game development I enjoyed and was interested in the most so decided to learn it for it's own sake. </p>
 <p> In February 2023 I began a computing degree course part time, whilst working as a Landscape Gardener. By July 2023 I was fortunate enough
to land my first software job, leaving behind a 10 year career in manual labour to join a wholesale company as a trainee programmer. My day job
consists of maintaining and developing their ERP system, written in COBOL and running on a UNIX system, with the oldest code dating to the late 70s. 
I also administer the system, providing support to users, assist the business with reporting from the database, coordinate 3rd party development and do 
acceptance testing of 3rd party solutions. </p>
<p> Outside of work and my university studies, I have explored other languages, spending the most time over the last 2 years learning C. After leaving 
numerous unfinished projects in various stages of completion, I actually finished something which was a simple Tetris clone. Along the way I have also 
built up a small personal C library which i've called ow_units, containing some basic functionality. Admittedly I have spent much time reinventing wheels, 
but that was really the point, to learn and practice. </p>
<p> After finishing the Tetris project and thinking 'what next?' I decided I needed to learn Git so made my Github profile, and created my first two repos, 
for Tetris and ow_units. Now I've turned my attention to learning the fundamentals of web development, something I will cover in my degree before long, but
wanted to get a headstart. This brings me to creating this page. </p>
