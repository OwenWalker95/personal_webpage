<h2> About </h2>
<h3> Overview </h3>
<p>Started sometime in 2024. This is a 'library' of C functions and data structures I've built up through doing my side projects while learning C.</p>
<p>As I wanted to focus on learning the language rather than learning various libraries and having things abstraced away, I coded everything from scratch besides the lower level input/output operations.
 For those I utilised the SDL library </p>
<p>Still very much a work in progress and something I will add to if I continue working in C. </p>
