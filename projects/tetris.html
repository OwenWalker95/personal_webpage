<h2> About </h2>
<h3> Overview </h3>
<p>Started around March 2025. 'Finished' June 2026</p>
<p>After numerous small projects in C which never materialised into anything, I started making a simple Tetris clone. I decided this was something I could 
actually bring to some sort of completion without spending too long on it.</p>
<p>There are still improvements I could make, mostly smoothness of the animations and aesthetic improvements. Some sort of hi-score system. And the code itself could do with tidying up.</p>
<p>I may revisit it at some point, but the aim of this was just to get a sense of 'completion'.</p>
<p>This was developed on linux for windows subsystem, has not been tested on any other machine. </p>
